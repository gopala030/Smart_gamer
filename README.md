# Smart_gamer

In this project we will first write a cv program for object detection and then a simple game using pygames.
Then we will integrate these two, to make a game controlled through object image processing.
Next we will write a game AI using using behaviour tree to play the game.
After this we will tweak our game a bit so that it can be played by 2 players against each other and then write a final game AI to play the game against a 
human competitor who will be controlling the game using a object through image dectetion.
